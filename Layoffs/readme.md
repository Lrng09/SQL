# Layoffs Data Cleaning

## Overview
In this project, I focused on preparing a raw dataset for analysis by performing essential data cleaning tasks to improve its consistency and usability. 

<ins>The key steps included:</ins>

* Removing Duplicates: Identified and eliminated duplicate records to prevent skewed analysis.

* Standardizing Data: Standardized formats for dates and text to ensure consistency across the dataset.

* Handling Null/Blank Values: Dealt with missing data through removal.

* Removing Unnecessary Columns/Rows: Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns and rows to streamline the dataset and focus on meaningful information.
